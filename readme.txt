Add subscription buttons in any Wordpress blog with this simple integration of Onscribe.


== Description ==

Onscribe allows everyone to launch a subscription service with multiple providers from their Wordpress site.

Whether you're a blogger or an artist, you work hard producing your content. And although it may be a labour of love, you deserve to be rewarded for your efforts.

Onscribe takes the pain out of setting up payment gateways and makes it a snap for you to add subscription buttons to your site, blog, app or online game, so all your fans can actively show their support in a meaningful way.

The Wordpress plugin is designed with ease of use in mind, making it easy to include subscription buttons anywhere on the site through the use of shortcodes.

A few highlights of the service:

* Simple integration with Wordpress

* All inclusive UI for both publishers and subscribers
* Extensible through API

Like Wordpress, Onscribe is people-centric and wants to give more power to its users.
